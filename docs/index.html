                        <p class="mb-3">An honest, reliable and committed developer who has spent almost 10 years
                            working
                            in a fast paced, agile software development environment within the pharmaceutical

                            Starting as an IT apprentice, then spending two years in quality assurance, I was able to
                            learn
                            the software development lifecycle whilst training as a programmer. I then moved into a full
                            stack software development role in 2019, using Blazor and entity framework for front and
                            back

                        <h5>2019 - Present / Software Developer</h5>
                        <p class="mb-3">In 2019, I was placed into a development role in the inception of a new
                            development
                            team as the
                            company began it's transition from Cobol technologies into the C#/.NET world.
                            In this role, I played a pivotal part in ensuring best practices were followed, and
                            developed a
                            business critical application which enabled the integration of third party pharmaceutical
                            software, ProScript, and the BD Rowa Dose system to deliver patient specific pouch packaging
                            direct to patient. This software took the company from producing x pouches per week to x
                            within
                            x years.</p>
                        <p class="mb-3">
                            I then converted an on premise, legacy VB
                            application that used Access for the backend into a C# solution with an SQL server backend
                            hosted in Azure. This application aids Goods Manufacturing and therefore falls under GMP,
                            meaning an extremely high level of attention to detail and validation was required, which is
                            where
                            past experience as a QA really helped to assure a level of quality within the product. This
                            is a native,
                            WPF application which utilises a framework I helped to design to aid development. During
                            this time, I began
                            learning Blazor and Razor in my own time, knowing that was the next steps that the company
                            wanted to take.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-3">
                            The next application was an Azure hosted Blazor Server PWA with full .NET technologies.
                            Utilising Blazor/DevExpress Blazor library for the UI
                            and Entity Framework for the backend. The application was intended to aid with the placement
                            of
                            locums in pharmacies and therefore has a front end mobile app, developed by a third party,
                            which
                            required us exposing
                            API endpoints for safe integration. This project involved liaison with multiple parties and
                            a
                            vast understanding of technologies in order to
                            deliver the correct solution.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-3">
                            The aforementioned locum planning application is one of eight applications that I have aided
                            in the conversion
                            from on premise, legacy applications to fully cloud based solutions. In doing so, the team
                            and I have implemented
                            DevOps solutions to aid the deployment into production environments, from creating ARM
                            templates for creating idempotent resources
                            to pipelines for immutable application deployment through to QA testing, user testing and
                            eventually production.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-3">
                            During this time, I attended the X DevOps course to gain better understanding of DevOps
                            principles and aim to continue learning
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-3">
                            More recently, the company has taken on graduate developers who have been placed within my
                            team to work alongside me on projects and I have been trusted to help their personal development
                            as competent software developers with much success.

                        <p class="mb-3">Progressing from my apprenticeship, I was placed in a trainee quality assurance
                            role. By this
                            point, I had already integrated into the team as a trusted tester and had a great
                            understanding
                            of the development lifecycle. I began taking on more business critical developments and
                            worked
                            closely with senior leadership to deliver a software solution in Cobol for an exclusive
                            multi-million pound
                            contract with a medical manufacturer.
                        </p>
                        <p>During this time, I always felt more passionate about software
                            development, so therefore learnt the development side in my own time alongside work and my
                            studies.
                            I spent spare time investigating defects that I had raised as a QA and aimed to send the
                            solution back to the developers alongside the defect.</p>

                            academic studies, I started by creating small test cases to demonstrate knowledge of the
                            system.
                            I was then trusted to carry out testing on small developments whilst integrating into a
                            small
                            scrum team. At the end of my apprenticeship, I was given a 'team leader' role, which
